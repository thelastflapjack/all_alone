# All Alone

An open source round based zombie survival game created in the Godot engine (3.5.1) with C#. Unlock new rooms, buy better guns, collect power-ups and shoot off zombie heads. How long will you survive?

This is an open source project distributed under the MIT License. For license reasons, some audio files are not included with the rest of the source but a [text file](/missing_audio_info.txt) has been included which details where you can download them for yourself from [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/).

I plan on getting back to this project to develop it further. This current version has all of the basics in place to build on top of. I would like to add a power system, special point defence rounds and a few other things.
